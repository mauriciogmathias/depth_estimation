# depth_estimation

In this experiment, I used the MiDaS model from TensorFlow to estimate depth from both static images and live webcam feeds. There are two scripts: 
1. **`depth_estimation.py`** for predicting depth from a saved image.
2. **`test_with_cam.py`** for capturing a frame from a webcam and predicting its depth.
